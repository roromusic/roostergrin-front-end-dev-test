### *Please also submit a small write up discussing (leave answers to a sentence or two):*

  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
  
  This project was built with React, using animate.css for animation. React proves to be useful when you need to change the view based on async requests (such as showing a loader icon when waiting for an async request to finish - in this case, I mimicked it using setTimeout).
  I also opted to use flexbox instead of using a library like bootstrap - I find flexbox's ability to rearrange the visual order of items on a webpage very powerful and easy. 

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

  Using React for a static website is a little bit of an overkill, but it seemed appropriate as a way to showcase my proficiency using a framework.

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why

  My favorite part was definitely making the modal. React's state changes came in handy for this part, and I am always amazed at how React works its magic. 
  Animations are also always fun, and I ended up making a custom loader icon for the form submission.
